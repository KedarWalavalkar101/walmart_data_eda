This a project where I conducted EDA and adhoc-analytics to better understand the sales data of Walmart.
The first step was some data cleaning and preparation to make the data useable for further analysis.
The analysis included understanding the various customer-types of Walmart and their behavioural patterns (e.g. is there any corelation between the ratings and the day of the week), the revenue sales generated through various product-lines etc.
